#Spiro software concept has a US Patent.

Since this code was ported in UK it's unclear to me if this applies for users in Europe or UK.
The whole concept of Software Patents is not widely accepted in UK and widely debated. 
Personally I am not a big fan I believe that software licences should be enough.

For UK and European users the US Patent does not automatically apply, and it's a grey area.
This link seems to offer some guidence. Generally in Europe Software patents do not apply.

1.         whether the claimed technical effect has a technical effect on a process which is carried on outside the computer;
2.         whether the claimed technical effect operates at the level of the architecture of the computer; that is to say whether the effect is produced irrespective of the data being processed or the applications being run;
3.         whether the claimed technical effect results in the computer being made to operate in a new way;
4.         whether there is an increase in the speed or reliability of the computer; and
5.         whether the perceived problem is overcome by the claimed invention as opposed to merely being circumvented.
